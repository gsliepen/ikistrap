# Welcome

This is an example wiki to show off the ikistrap theme.
Ikistrap tries to provide a fully-featured, modern looking HTML5 theme for ikiwiki.
It uses Bootstrap 5 and Bootstrap Icons.

## Features

Ikistrap has the following features:

* Good use of HTML5 semantic elements.
* Responsive layout.
* Standards-compliant.
* Compatible with text-only browsers.
* Header supporting parentlinks, wiki actions, search form, language selection and trails.
* Sidebar styled as a Boostrap 5 card, using the Bootstrap 5 grid system.
* Footer that is pushed down to the bottom of the screen with tags, backlinks, copyright, license and modification date.
* [[Inline pages]] that are by default styled as Bootstrap 5 cards.
* [[Comments]]
* [[Calendars]]

Note that ikistrap doesn't add any special support for Bootstrap to the Markdown language.
If you want to make use of [[Bootstrap features]] inside your text, you will have to manually add the appropriate HTML tags.
