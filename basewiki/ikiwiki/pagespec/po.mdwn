     else="This wiki has po support **disabled**."]]

If the [[!iki plugins/po desc=po]] plugin is enabled, the regular
[[ikiwiki/PageSpec]] syntax is expanded with the following additional
tests that can be used to improve user navigation in a multi-lingual
wiki:

* "`lang(LL)`" - tests whether a page is written in the language
  specified as a ISO639-1 (two-letter) language code.
* "`currentlang()`" - tests whether a page is written in the same
  language as the current page.
* "`needstranslation()`" - tests whether a page needs translation
  work. Only slave pages match this PageSpec. A minimum target
  translation percentage can optionally be passed as an integer
  parameter: "`needstranslation(50)`" matches only pages less than 50%
  translated.

Note that every non-po page is considered to be written in
`po_master_language`, as specified in `ikiwiki.setup`.
